# Tumor-Classifiation-AI
Machine Learning Model to Classify Tumors

Engineered an AI model designed for tumor classification. This machine learning model was trained on data from real breast cancer diagnoses with the primary function of effectively differentiating tumors into 2 categories: malignant or benign. In the field of Radiology, not only does this AI streamline and enhance the accuracy of tumor classification, but it also holds the potential to significantly impact patient outcomes, ultimately saving lives.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn 

The script will go through dataset and give the first column a 1 for malignant and 0 for benign
